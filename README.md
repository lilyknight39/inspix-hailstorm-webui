# inspix-hailstorm

This is a fork of https://github.com/vertesan/inspix-hailstorm. Thanks to the original author and contributors.

An all-in-one tool suite to analyze/decrypt Link Like Love Live resources and the master database, with a CLI and an experimental WebUI.

For the Chinese version, see `README.zh-CN.md`.

## Features

- Download and decrypt assets and the master database
- Database structure analysis mode for developers
- Experimental WebUI for browsing and search
- Docker workflow support

## Quick Start

You can build from source or run via container.

### Build from Source

```bash
go build .
```

After building, use `./hailstorm -h` for options. Common flags:

- No flags: download and decrypt all new assets and DB since the last run
- `--analyze`: analyze database structure for developers
- `--dbonly`: database only, skip assets
- `--web`: start WebUI (default `127.0.0.1:5001`)

### WebUI

Run from project root:

```bash
go run . --web --addr 127.0.0.1:5001
```

Or run after build:

```bash
./hailstorm --web --addr 127.0.0.1:5001
```

Open in browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

### WebUI Preview Extras

The WebUI can generate richer previews for some asset types when optional tools
are available:

- ACB audio preview: requires `vgmstream-cli` and `ffmpeg` in `PATH`.
  Preview output is cached under `cache/webui-preview/acb`.
- Unity assetbundle preview: set `ASSETRIPPER_DIR` to your
  AssetRipper release folder (containing `AssetRipper.GUI.Free`).
  Inspix-hailstorm will start AssetRipper in headless mode and call its
  export API automatically. Output is cached under
  `cache/webui-preview/assetbundle/<label>`.
- If the WebUI shows "Export not configured", check:
  - Assetbundle export: `ASSETRIPPER_DIR` is set in your shell
    environment before launching the WebUI, and the binary exists.
  - ACB audio preview: `vgmstream-cli` and `ffmpeg` are available in `PATH`.

Example (set AssetRipper directory):

```bash
export ASSETRIPPER_DIR="/path/to/AssetRipper_release_folder"
```

Notes:
- AssetRipper uses `--port` (default 23600) when started by inspix-hailstorm.
- Preview output is derived from `cache/plain`; ensure the plain cache exists.

Detailed steps:

Assetbundle export (AssetRipper GUI Web)
1) Install AssetRipper from the official releases and locate `AssetRipper.GUI.Free`.
2) Set `ASSETRIPPER_DIR` to the release folder.
3) Generate `cache/plain` with inspix-hailstorm (run a normal update or convert mode) so the assetbundle file exists.
4) Start inspix-hailstorm with WebUI; it will launch AssetRipper headless and
   call `/LoadFile` and `/Export/PrimaryContent` automatically.
   Reference: https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/blob/master/Source/AssetRipper.GUI.Web/WebApplicationLauncher.cs

Notes:
- AssetRipper rejects export paths that are system directories (Desktop/Documents/Downloads).
- `--headless` avoids launching the browser. `--port` is supported by AssetRipper GUI Web.

ACB audio preview
1) Install `vgmstream-cli` and `ffmpeg` and ensure both are in `PATH`.
2) Use "Export & Preview" on an `.acb` entry.

### Docker

Image:
https://github.com/vertesan/inspix-hailstorm/pkgs/container/inspix-hailstorm

Run `run_docker.sh` to start the container.
Defaults to `dbonly`; override via docker CLI `--entrypoint` if needed.
